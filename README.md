![Q-chat-demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb242fb1-b554-4ea3-b938-896318715866)

An onversational agentic platform designed to make financial literacy accessible, actionable, and engaging for youngstars. It explains complex financial concepts in clear, jargon-free language, provides real-life examples with an Indian investment context, and delivers answers in structured formats.


### Active Features

- **Streaming Responses(SSE)**: Engage in conversations with LLMs with Chat renders token-by-token from /chat-stream for a interactive user experience.

- **Agent Tool Telemetry**: Inline stages show what the agent is doing—**searching → reading → writing**—with tool outputs surfaced where helpful.

- **Generative UI-First Rendering**: Renders JSON UI specs (charts, tables, KPIs) generated by the agent via C1 UI generation—powered in the app by `@thesysai/genui-sdk.`

- **Web Search Integration**: The Agent can perform web searches (web crawl-based) on demand to provide up-to-date and relevant information, showing the user with the concurent information. 

- **Responsive Design**: A fully responsive interface that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices, featuring an adaptable sidebar.

- **Developer Playground**: A dedicated `/playground` route for testing individual UI components.

⚠️ Features like **Chat History**, **Search Conversation** won't work as ``authentication strategy`` hasn't been designd/configured yet from the backend.
